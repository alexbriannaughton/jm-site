                <p>A diverse musical education, along with itinerant life experience, has shaped me as a boundary breaking
                    composer. Born in Uganda to Mennonite missionaries, I was exposed to the kalimba-driven music of
                    East Africa as well as traditional four-part hymns. Guitar study began in elementary school in
                    emulation of my dad, a musician and luthier by avocation, and continued with Texas swing legend Kenny Frazier, whose lessons emphasized music theory and
                    improvisation. I devoured everything from
                    Miles to Lil Wayne to The Beatles. I attended the University of North Texas, studying guitar,
                    composition, and West African drumming. A 2012 study trip to Ghana dissolved the lines my own
                    culture had drawn between music, dancing, community and religion, as well as the notion of discrete
                    “songs” with a clear beginning and end. Ghanaian music existed as integral to life and spirituality.
                    Now based in Seattle, I create music as JM Fodder, and perform frequently as a sideman across the Pacific Northwest. My inclusivity regarding genre drives me to create new music
                    that is pointedly distinct from my latest works. I have recently immersed myself in
                    creating electronic music. My latest album, Our Fodder, out in March 2023, uses Ableton Live to present
                    improvised avant-garde electronic dance music. </p>
